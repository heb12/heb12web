            <p>Heb12 is a project started in March of 2018 to make Bible applications for different operating systems. The name Heb12 refers to Hebrews 4:12. </p>
            <blockquote>For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart.</blockquote>
            <p>Gods word is very powerful. That is why we are working on making it even more accessible to modern technology.</p>
